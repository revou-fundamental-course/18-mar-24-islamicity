I'd recommend against directly including external stylesheets within the HTML for a WordPress landing page. Here's a more effective approach:

**1. Use a WordPress Theme:**

* Leverage the built-in styling capabilities of a pre-designed WordPress theme. Many themes offer customization options for colors, fonts, and layouts. Popular free themes like Astra, GeneratePress, and OceanWP provide a good foundation.
* Premium themes like Avada, Divi, and BeTheme offer advanced customization options and pre-built layouts that might suit your needs perfectly. 

**2. Utilize the WordPress Customizer:**

* Most themes come with a built-in WordPress Customizer. This allows you to visually adjust colors, fonts, backgrounds, and other design elements without needing to edit code directly.

**3. Consider a Page Builder Plugin (Optional):**

* Popular page builder plugins like Elementor, Beaver Builder, and Visual Composer provide drag-and-drop interfaces to build your landing page layout and style it. These can be particularly helpful if you want a highly customized design.

**External Stylesheets (for Advanced Customization):**

While not the primary approach, you can still use external stylesheets for specific customization:

* **Font Awesome:** A popular icon library ([https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/)) that provides various icons you can integrate into your design using CSS.
* **Google Fonts:** A vast library of free fonts ([https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)) you can use to enhance your website's typography by linking them in the `<head>` section of your HTML (as you have in your example).
* **Custom CSS:** If your theme or page builder doesn't offer enough design control, you can create a custom CSS file (e.g., `style.css`) and enqueue it in your theme's functions.php file. This allows for more granular control over specific design elements.

**Here's a breakdown of how it would work in your `style.css` file (assuming you enqueue it correctly):**

```css
/* Basic styles */
body {
  font-family: Lato, sans-serif; /* Using the Google Font you linked */
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1, h2, p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 1rem;
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: black;
}

a:hover {
  color: #333;
}

/* Further styles based on your theme and desired customization */

```

**Remember:** When using external stylesheets, prioritize those hosted by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for faster loading times.

**Additional Tips:**

* Research Islamic website design trends for inspiration. 
* Ensure your website is responsive and mobile-friendly.
* Use high-quality images and videos to showcase your pesantren.
* Keep the content clear, concise, and engaging for your target audience.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the built-in features of WordPress, you can create a visually appealing and informative landing page for your Pesantren Masyarakat Digital.
